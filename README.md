# discord-mod-bot
A discord bot with basic moderation commands.

Prefix is '!'. Currently has commands to add and remove roles from users, as well as kick and ban users. Includes a help command listing these commands and how to use them.
Requires the npm module discord.js

To-do list for features I plan to add:
- A help message listing commands and features upon joining a new server
- Mute and unmute commands with a role to prevent muted users typing in text channels
- Option to allow server members to self-assign certain roles
